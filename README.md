# Auto Confirm Static Popups
## About
As a fan of the functionality this addon provides, I'm updating it to support ~~Shadowlands~~ ~~Dragonflight~~ The War Within!

## Credits
All credit to this addon goes to the original author - I only cleaned it up a bit and made it work in later versions of the game

## Installation
~~Download and remane the top-level folder to ConfirmSP then move the folder to your WoW addons folder~~

NOW AVAILABLE ON [CURSEFORGE](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/confirm-static-popups)!!

## Known Limitations
Blizzard makes API changes and it breaks things... but all the most critical things work ...most of the time ;P
